# Lumberjack
### Lumberjack is a windows command line tool for email spoofing. It can be used to trick your friends into thinking that you've hacked their email, or jut for pulling a quick prank on someone. 
### Lumberjack can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jptr218/lumberjack/raw/main/lumberjack.exe) (you will need to run it from the command line)
