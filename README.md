### Lumberjack is an command line based email spoofer I've made. You can use it to prank your friends, or trick peopl einto thinking your a hacker. However, you might want to avoid spoofing Outlook emails as you may be put on a [watchlist](https://www.spamhaus.org/pbl/).
## Lumberjack can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jptr218/lumberjack/raw/main/lumberjack.exe) (you will need to run it from the command line)
