# Lumberjack
### Lumberjack is a windows command line tool for email spoofing. It can be used to trick your friends into thinking that you've hacked their email, or just for pulling a quick prank on someone. However, you should be cautious as you might be put on a [watchlist](https://www.spamhaus.org/pbl/).
### Lumberjack can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jptr218/lumberjack/raw/main/lumberjack.exe) (you will need to run it from the command line)
## **Note: I do not take any responsibility for what you use this tool for.**
